  <h2>In a nutshell</h2>
<p>I am passionate about developing computer programs that eliminate mundane task by exploring software solutions for known and unknown problems by acquiring knowledge from experience and learning.</p>
<p>I am studying as a Graduate master's student in computer science department at Kansas State University. In my program, I have concentrated on data handling from the traditional relational database and to storage-retrieval of big data in NoSQL based databases. And also concentrated on effective usage of employing programming paradigm such as imperative, functional, object-oriented, procedural and logical to build the application. I am working now on an automatic SQL grader project that evaluates assignment submission for relational database queries.</p>
<p>With professional industry experience as a Java and Database developer at Tech Mahindra Ltd. for a data migration project for 3 years, I worked in a project that migrates customer billing account details from legacy systems to new stacks using ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) technique.In the project, I contributed in extending existing functionality to handle new billing account type, catalyzing migration by automating using java, shell script and PLSQL in scheduling, error notification, file processing and external component interaction.</p>
<p>I believe analytical, problem-solving, debugging, studious, communication and learning from mistakes are the skills essential in a project to build programming project. I harness and endow in developing these skills.</p>
